# Files from section 2

You can find some of the sample code from section, along with my notes on the
code, in [`sample_code.ml`](sample_code.ml). I didn't manage to fully cover everything that I
wanted to so I highly recommend that you look through it.

My notes on recursion are in [`recursion.pdf`](recursion.pdf).

## How to install utop

[`utop`](https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/about-utop/) is an enhanced OCaml
interpreter with features like autocompletion. If you have `opam` installed (see
section 1 materials), you can install `utop` using

```
opam install utop
```

Then `utop` should be available as a command.
