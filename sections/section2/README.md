# Files from section 2

You can find some of the sample code from section, along with my notes on the
code, in [`demo.ml`](demo.ml). I didn't manage to fully cover everything that I
wanted to so I highly recommend that you look through it.

My notes on recursion are in [`recursion.pdf`](recursion.pdf).
