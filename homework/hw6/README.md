# Programming Assignment #6

- You have to implement all solutions in Datalog. 

- Install [Souffle](https://souffle-lang.github.io/install).

## Steensgaard pointer analysis (20 points)

[Steensgaard pointer analysis](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/237721.237727) algorithm operates in near-linear time, supporting essentially unlimited scalability in practice. In this assignment, you need to implement this algorithm in Datalog.

## Andersen pointer analysis (20 points)

Andersenâ€™s points-to analysis is a context-insensitive interprocedural analysis. It is also a flow-insensitive analysis that does not take into consideration the order of program statements.  

In this assignment, you need to implement this algorithm using Datalog.

## Interprocedural taint analysis (20 points)

Taint analysis (i.e., informational flow analysis) is the foundation for security and system research. In this assignment, you need to implement an interprocedural taint analysis using Datalog.


## Integrate your taint analysis into real-world applications  (10 points)

This is a bonus question.
