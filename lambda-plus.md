# Getting started with Î»<sup>+</sup>

In this course, you will need two important tools: the manual, and the reference
interpreter (called `lamp`, short for "lambda plus"). Both can be downloaded
from Gauchospace and will be updated regularly, so make sure you have the latest
versions when you are doing the homeworks.

## Using `lamp`

The `lamp` binary provided on Gauchospace is compiled for Linux. This means that
you will either need to 1) run it on CSIL; or 2) run it from your own Linux
installation.

Once you have downloaded it on to your Linux machine of choice, you can execute
`lamp` directly to start a REPL (read-eval-print-loop):

```plain
[bryantan@csilvm-02 demo]$ ls
lamp
[bryantan@csilvm-02 demo]$ ./lamp
Welcome to lambda+!
> 

```

You can then type in an expression and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> to evaluate it:

```plain
> 1 + 2 * 3
<== 1 + (2 * 3)
==> 7
```

The `<==` line will show the expression that `lamp` will actually evaluate, while the
`==>` line shows the final value obtained by evaluating the expression. The former is
quite useful when you are using syntax sugar like the `fun` syntax:

```plain
> fun add_five with n = n + 5 in add_five 3
<== let add_five = lambda n. n + 5 in add_five 3
==> 8
```

`lamp` will also show a program trace when a runtime error occurs. This is to
make it easier to debug your programs and interpreter implementations:

```plain
> let x = !1 in 2 @ x
<== let x = !1 in 2 @ x
error: Cannot take head of non-cons value
in expression !1
in expression let x = !1 in 2 @ x
```

Here, we are attempting to take the head of an integer, but this is not allowed
because head is only defined for cons cells.
