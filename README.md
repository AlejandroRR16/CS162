# CS162 Programming Languages

Programming Languages are the duct tape, bricks, mortar and steel of the information age. Over the last thirty years, a variety of languages with diverse features have been developed, expressive radically different perspectives of the idea of computation. CSE 162 is an introduction to these different perspectives, the fundamental concepts of languages, and how modern language techniques and idioms can be used to engineer software systems. For this purpose, we shall focus on three different paradigms -- functional, object-oriented and logic programming as embodied in OCaml, Python and Datalog.

# Academic Integrity
- Cheating WILL be taken seriously. It is not fair toward honest students to take cheating lightly, nor is it fair to the cheater to let him/her go on thinking that cheating is a reasonable alternative in life.
- The following is not considered cheating:
   - discussing broad ideas about programming assignments in groups, without being at a computer (with code-writing and debugging done individually, later).
- The following is considered cheating:
   - discussing programming assignments with someone who has already completed the problem, or looking at their completed solution.
   - looking at anyone else’s solution
   - looking at solutions from the web, previous versions of the class, or anywhere else.
   - leaving your code (for example in an online repository) visible to others, leading others to look at your solution.
   - receiving, providing, or soliciting assistance from unauthorized sources during a test.
- Programming assignments are not intended to be grade-makers, but to prepare you for the tests, which are the grade-makers. Cheating on the programming assignment is not only unethical, but shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose of these assignments.
- Penalties: If the teaching staff become aware of any violations of these rules by a student I will initiate the actions described in the Policy on Academic Integrity. If found responsible, the academic sanctions may result in a zero for the assignment, a zero for that portion of your grade, an “F” in the course, among others.
